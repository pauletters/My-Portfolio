## Description
I created this portfolio page to give potential employers an easy and convenient way to learn about me and some of the projects I have accomplished. It also allows users to contact me with a message should they have questions or want to discuss anything further. Finally, it provides a link to download my resume to delve a bit deeper into my career and experience.
